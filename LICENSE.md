Ah, c'est une distinction très importante !
Vous avez tout à fait raison, la licence MIT est une licence logicielle permissive, très courante pour le code, mais ce n'est pas la même chose que la licence Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) que vous aviez spécifiée pour votre travail.
La licence CC BY 4.0 est plus adaptée pour le contenu créatif, les publications, les données, etc., ce qui correspond bien à votre document de recherche.
Puisque GitHub ne vous propose pas directement le modèle CC BY 4.0, il est impératif de ne PAS choisir MIT.
Voici la marche à suivre pour ajouter la licence CC BY 4.0 manuellement :
 * Nommez le fichier LICENSE.md
   * Quand vous êtes sur la page "Create new file" sur GitHub, tapez LICENSE.md dans le champ du nom du fichier.
 * Collez le texte intégral de la licence CC BY 4.0
   * Dans la grande zone de texte en dessous du nom du fichier, collez le texte complet de la licence CC BY 4.0. Je vous le redonne ci-dessous pour plus de facilité :
